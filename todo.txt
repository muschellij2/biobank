Get quantiles for each subject
For minute level data - done
seq(0, 1, by = 0.1) - done
4496053_90004_0_0 - is crazy
Get same for 3:00-5:00AM

- done

For 5 second and minute:
Mode -done
Hist of mode for all them
Plot around 100
Look at KDE

Histogram of all minute level data across all people
	- define a threshold there

Inclusion/exclusion criteria for data
Popn threshold/mode

# Normalization to the mode
p = pnorm(-1)
q_1sd = quantile(before the mode, probs = p)
mode - q_1sd = sigma


Problems:
Identifying
Minute level
   - Per-day medians/means
   - Overall mean
   - Variance
Number of points > 2 g
Variability of 10AM data


2.  Write chapter for ciprian (2-3 hours)
1.  Write 1 fucking paragraph of binroc
	- 1 before doing anything else.
	- even if nonsense
3.  Do 10 slides for talk (also see how long the talk is) - find old talk (5 min from dept) and the one from Zeffiro
